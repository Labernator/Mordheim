For the 2024 Campaign edition we want to do a lot of things differently/better than before.
We have seen more than mordheim by now and know of its short comings.
Let's use this list to guide the conversation. 

## Alternating activation

Marius: Turn based activation is stupid.
Is there any issue with alternating activation in Mordheim?
Is Group activation an issue?

## Lasting injury table

Marius: The injury table in mordheim feels bad and too punishing.
I would suggest to alter it to be more like Necromunda.


LASTING INJURY TABLE
| D66 | Injury Name |	Lasting Injury |
| :-----: |-------------| :-----|
| 11	| Lesson Learned: | The fighter goes into Convalescence but gains D3 Experience. |
| 12	| Impressive Scars: | The fighter’s Leadership is increased by 1. This bonus only applies once, treat all further results as Out Cold. |
| 13	| Horrid Scars: | The fighter gains the Fearsome skill. If they already have the Fearsome skill, treat this result as Out Cold. |
| 14	| Bitter Enmity: | When fighting a battle against the warband that inflicted this injury, the fighter gains the Hatred skill against that warband. If they already have the Hatred skill or roll this result a second time, treat it as Out Cold. |
| 15-26 |	Out Cold: | The fighter misses the rest of the battle, but avoids any long term injuries. The fighter recovers in time to perform post-battle actions. |
| 31-36	| Convalescence:| The fighter goes into Convalescence. |
| 41	| Old Battle Wound: | At the end of each battle this fighter participates in roll a D6, on a 1 the fighter goes into Convalescence. |
| 42	| Partially Deafened: | The fighter suffers no penalty if they are partially deafened, however, suffering this injury again reduces their Leadership by 1. |
| 43	| Humiliated: | The fighter goes into Convalescence and their Leadership is decreased by 1. |
| 44	| Eye Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Ballistic Skill characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 45	| Hand Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Weapon Skill characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 46	| Hobbled: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Movement characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 51	| Spinal Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Strength characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 52	| Enfeebled: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Toughness characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 53	| Head Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Initiative characteristic is each decreased by 1. |
| 54	| Multiple Injuries: | The fighter is not dead but has suffered many serious wounds. Roll a further D3 times on this table re-rolling any results of Captured, Multiple Injuries, Memorable Death, Critical Injury or Out Cold. |
| 55-56	| Captured: | The fighter might be Captured. |
| 61-65	| Critical Injury: | The fighter is in a critical condition – if their injuries are not successfully treated by a visit to the Doc (see Medical Escort) in the post-battle sequence, they will die. |
| 66	| Memorable Death: | The fighter is killed instantly – not even the most talented Doc can save them. If the injury was caused by an Attack action, the attacker gains 1 additional XP. |

Convalescence heißt für mich, dass der Mann nicht für die Wyrdstone Suche und so nicht zur Verfügung steht.
Habe Int durch Ini ersetzt und Cool gestrichen. Leadership ist king! ;)
Berserker habe ich durch Hatred ersetzt.

Sonst mapped das echt gut. Einzig für die Critical Injury müssen wir uns etwas überlegen. Gibt es dann auch nen rogue doc?

## Advancements

Marius: I dislike the random aspect of the mordheim advances. It feels bad to get only leadership when all others are buffing strength and toughness

## Critical hits

Marius: Crits are a problem in my opinion... period. Armour is completely irrelevant when you have crits.

## Injury rolls

Marius: I love this necromunda mechanic. Can we port that somehow? 

## Hero wounds

Marius: it feels strange that most heroes only have 1 wound. I like the necromunda heroes with at least 2. Maybe we can modify something here (+1 Wound for all heros on creation for another 30gc or something like this)

## Mutiny in Marienburg

Marius: We need to shorten the campaign to max. 8-9 games. Otherwise we will NEVER finish it.

## Fixed income (Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen)

Stefan: Necromunda with its territories introduced fixed income for all bands. This is a good mechanism, we should port to Mordheim so the "rich get richer" is not that big a problem as in the past

## Old House rules revisited
Here is the list of house rules from our last campaign:

### Charge
> A charge move is done by adding +D6 to the movement of a warrior instead of doubling the movement (Core S. 26). Therefore you are always allowed to measure.

Marius: after playing Necromunda I got a taste of "no measuring". I would just remove the last part of the sentence but keep the variance in charges

### Armour
> Light, Heavy und Gromril Armour have +1 AS (Core S. 32). Light Armour grants a 5+, Heavy Armour a 4+ and Gromril Armour a +3+ AS.

Marius: good one

### Dual Wielding
> When using two weapons in melee, both weapons are resolved at -1 to hit (Core S. 35)

Marius: good one

### Henchmen are only here for the rations
> Henchmen do not gain experience. After 3 scenarios you may choose one non-large, non-animal henchman to be promoted. If for any reason, you don't have 6 heroes after game 5, another non-large, non-animal henchman is promoted.

Marius: I don't like this one. It marginalizes henchmen. But with the random advance system this is a source of heavy imbalance.

### Shots fired!
> No more than 50% of warriors within a warband (both heroes and henchmen) may be equipped with a ranged weapon that has a range of more than 6".

Marius: good one

### Large / Animal Henchmen
> Henchmen with either the "Large" or the "Animal" rule can neither climb nor use ladders.

Marius: good one

### Too many heroes to divide the spoils
> Every warband may have at maximum 5 starting heroes. No more. It doesn't matter what the warband book says.

Marius: goodish. Warbands with 6 heroes are mostly sketchy. Maybe we can take another hard look at them?!

### Banned skills for this campaign:
Strongman
Sprint
Quick shot
Shaggy Hide (Beastmen)
Nurgle's Rot

Marius: I have mixed feelings. We banned these because they were auto includes. Turned out, now we had other auto includes. I can see us go either way.

### Winning
> Every warband that fulfills the winning conditions is considered a winner. Meaning there can be more than one winner. All winning warband leader e.g. gain +1 XP.

Marius: good one

### Strongman
> If a model already has the Strongman skill, it loses it and therefore gains the "No need for Weapons" skill that ignores the penalties of fighting unarmed.

Marius: see the comment above regarding the ban list.

### Underdog
> The underdog bonus is calculated against the strongest opposing warband.

Marius: good one

### Szenario Auswahl
> The warband with the lowest warband rating may choose the next scenario. If two or more warbands are tied for last place, roll off to see who may decide.

Marius: bad one. We want to have campaign progression

### The Hero Save
> After rolling all the injuries of your warband, and contemplating the total annihilation that would soon follow, the player may decide to call upon the Hero Save.\nIn doing so, the player decides to ignore all the injuries to all the models in the warband, but also renounces to all the experience gains of the game. All other post battle sequence steps take place as normal.\nNote: The exploration can therefore be made by all the heroes in the warband, as none was removed from the game.

Marius: this plays with the harsh mordheim injury table. If that would be softened a bit, I could see us keep this rule but have it never used!?

### MAGA (Make Armour great again)
> On the critical hit chart we replace all instances of "no armour saves allowed" with "the enemy armour save is modified by -2."

Marius: The critical hits in general are a problem as stated above

### Climbing
> Replace the second paragraph with this: \nAny model (except animals!) can climb up or down fences, walls, etc.\nHe must be touching what he wants to climb. He may climb up to his total Movement in a single movement phase.\nAny remaining movement can be used as normal.\nIf the height is more than the model’s normal move, he cannot climb the wall.

Marius: good one

### Unclaimed loot
> When all other players have routed, the remaining player gains an additional movement phase in which he might claim any loot on the table. All unclaimed loot after that phase is lost.

Marius: good one
