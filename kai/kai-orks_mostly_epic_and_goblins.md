## Lore
Doomed are the orks of the bloody sunz clan, the black ork boyz are suffering of an diabolic injury.

The bloodlust was growing bigger and bigger over centuries and no one could satisfy their morbid hankering.
Even after a great Waaagh! thee most of the member of the clan cant stop to fight and to scrap each other of their
brotherhood. They are lost and doomed to eradicate themselves. Every of the few chosen shaman in the clan tried
to get the bloddy sunz to calm down and to scavange their brains from the burning desire of the bloodlust.
All of them dies in a tremendous death of being eaten alive or got ripped in many parts.

Only one shaman survived the attack of the enraged orks - the nightgoblin shaman Gazbag. A gifted little and war proofen
warrior of the Waaagh! and the friend of Grumlok the pack leader of the black ork clan - bloody sunz.

The orks charged onto the little goblin which tried to subdue their spirits, and
catched them before his friend and side kick Grumlok even could react. Gazbag was knocked down and the outraged
boyz tried to ead his head. The only chance Grumlok had to protect his friend was to fight the smaller boyz and
to kill them all. Grumlok wrenched the bleeding and knocked down goblin behind his enormous back, holding his battle axe
in his left big and mighty hand.
The slightly green glow in his eyes - a sign of the purity of his mind and the conneciton to the Waaagh! -
has shown up and he knew that will be the only way to get out of this situation.

He blows his Axe in brutal and fast verves into the warband of the doomed orcs of his clan.
The guts, the limbs and their forked heads swirled around him - he was enraged because of the stupidity of his
boyz to drink the evil water from the skaven warlock and the fact that they were dull enough to fight
agains its old friend and side kick Gazbag.

No thought was in his mind during the fight to keep an eye onto the knocked down friend.
A mistake which he would never forget to rue. A squig which did not know to difference between
scam and bodys or friends which lie on the ground started to eat the brain out of the bleeding and broken open head of Gazbag.

A few seconds ago in the edge of his eye Grumlok noticed a shrug of Gazbag's lifeless body.
He turned around and wrecked the squig with the blade of his Axe into two pieces.
Gazbag his long friend, his side kick, his pal was dead.

With an aweful roar, Grumlok repealed the body, notwithstanding that there are still doomed boyz around him,
he took him out of the camp. The doomed boys confused and irritated about the boss who stopped to fight them,
leaped directly to the next fighting brother on their sided. None of them survived the massacre of this battle.
The last doomed boy who survived the battle died because he tried to fight against himself - he won in a heroic way of
a real ork warrior with a one hit decapitation.

Grumlok run - his target was the hut great shaman Woggah from the adversely clan of the
black snakes. An outstanding healer and also skillful in the usage of the Waaagh!.
Grumlok knew that his hut was a bit away from the camp of the clan. The black snake clan also know that it is to dangerous to keep shamans in
their camps. The Waaagh! they try to use and control lead to spontaneous bursting heads and huts. No ork was save in the near of
an orkide shaman outside of a battle.

His friend Gazbag fulfilled with the energy of the Waaagh! didn't die completely. The Waaagh! keept him alive,
at least his body. But his brain was eaten by the squig - which wasn't that bad because it prevented the burst of his head.
Grumlok was sure that there was no way to retrieve it, it was a puddle of mud.
But he does not accept that this may be the end of his mate.

Gazbak knows the shaman Woggah since the great Waagh! against the Northwall Elves n ancient times, which was a long time ago.
He knows him as a trust-able savant, a healer and outstanding battle witcher using the Waaagh! but also as a loony mind.

It was his only chance to safe the live of Gazbag, find Woggah and heal him or something.
For about four days and three nights Grumlok run through the mountain range and the wooden valley
till he arrived the hut of Woggah.

Reverent was the appearance of Woggah as he already stand in front of the door of his hut. His eyes were concealed under his hood, but the
same slightly green glow was visible - as it was visible in the eyes of Grumlok during the fight between him and it's clan.

Grumlok still tells the story that Gazbag bend up his upper part of the body and lifted up the broken head after Woggah said some words of Magic,
but the truth is that Woggah tried to focus a healing spell onto the dying body of Gazbag on the rite shrine in his hut. Two days he tried
to save him. Te regenerate his lost brain, to heal his broken head and to fulfill him with live. But at the end Woggah had to gave up, all his powers
fail. Gazbag'sbrain was dead. Only the body and the ability to hold himself on the shoulder Armour of Grumlok was regenerated.
For now on Gazbag the brain dead Goblin shaman was standing still on the shoulder of his friend and leader Grumlok. holding it's battle staff untill his Waaagh!
fulfilled body will die.

Grumlok tear up about the fact that his friend would be never the same pal as before and after days of suffering he decided not to
go back and rescue his old clan - he didn't know that they are already dead.

He decided to leave. To leaf the world he knows. To leaf his doomed clan. And his home. A achy truth has reached his mind, the War never will be
the same as before. With his two-handed battleaxe in his left hand and Gazbag on the shoulder of his Armour, he decamp the hut of Woggah,
turned around and spontaneously asked him to come along.

In his loony mind the giggling stopped for a long second and Woggah assented, he was tired to wait for the next visitor all the day in his hut.
And why don't accompany an old and retired warband leader on his adventures. Woggah never rue his decision - even because the giggling in his head
doesn't stop long enough to finish even a short idea to the end.

Weeks and months they were lurch through the world, no reason to stay, no reason to step on, no fight to blastoff no reason to retreat.
All happen during this obscure period of their ramble was that Woggah figured out that Gazbag self-evidently appear as a catalyst for the Waaagh!
- he can use to re-enforce his powers.

Later on they met the brothers of yawn - a covey of war zesty night goblins - four of them to be strictly correct.
Their names are Higgz, Snotz and Roddz the three spear-men and Gurnch the vicious sword fighter. Swords...
Grumlock looked at the two enormous small human bread knive sized chaser in their hand and on the top of their spears and started to grin.
He didn't know that toothpicks are used in combat.

Lorn - cause they lost their warband - and with a crank mood they mooched around a tavern, they were not allowed to enter.
All they wanted was to get drunk because of their lost pack and to sing about their past glorious fight.
Rodz also own a battle flute.
They are a very musically group, aren't they?

They firsthand got a sympathy to Grumlok and Gazbag - presumably because of the Goblin - and asked him in a direct goblish way if they can join
his warband. This would even be better than mooching around a tavern and waiting for the stranger who confirmed to buy and bring them
some beer. At least no one of the group were sure why it feel wrong to accompany a black ork leader with a braindead goblin shaman on his shoulder,
standing there like monkey like pet.

The goblins also didn't bother about the goals of their new warband and they are also not interested about the kind of job they have to do.
Their primary need was satisfied now, to be part of a warband and follow a big leader - in their case a really aweful black ork with a
brutal Battleaxe - what could be wrong with this happenstance.

Few weeks later - and a lot of incvoluntarily started fights - because the goblins provoke every one in a range of sight. Crazily, every time they
are sure that Grumlok will follow and protect them against their suspects of animosity.

But most of the time Grumlok was not interested to save the goblins, the target that his small mind figured out was the money and the treasure the
suspects victim carry. Most of them carry a lot of goldcrown, armory and weapon.

A few weeks later Grumlok collected a lot of equipment and money. He was sure for now that the new goal in his live would be to
hunt for treasure and scrap others for gold and armory.

This could go on for a long time he thought and kept the way of the road of plundering victim bags and all of the houses and taverns on theit way.

Untill they met three heroic orks aside the main street in a scurf. A outraging thunderstorm hovering over their heads.
Grumlok and his little warband stepped into the scurf and all of them instantly got a sword or Axe under their nose, or at least on the top of their
heads - goblins are that small.

Grumlok's eyes started to glow slightly green and his face started to show up very grim. Without any notable time lag one of the Orks - Grommok, the strongest one
with the two-handed war chopping weapon in his hand - fell down first. Followed by the other two outreaching combatants Karhag and Ug'lash.

Their place in the rule of precedence was clear - as Grumlok would not lose it's strength and stop to demonstrate it. The tree will follow for now on.
That's the simple rule of a orkish clan Grumlok was born for. He always was a leader and he was able to play his role, even if he gave up his clan, and his live as a warboss.

The three ork heroes told Grumlok that their previous target was the road to Mordheim and that they assume that there are lots of treasures to loot, victims to mug,
and more challenges to pass as they can.

In this moment of fight and the clarification of hierarchy the warband of mostly epic orks and goblins were born.
A warband to scavenge huge amounts of gold crowns, conquer for treasures and compete with other warbands for honor or at least not to get killed.
