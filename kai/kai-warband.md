|Oi Behave!| Funktioniert folgendermaßen: du sagst einen S2 hit an (das macht wohl oft Sinn). Dann kommt wie im Combat/shooting/zaubern der Verwundungswurf: S2 vs T4 verwundet nur auf die 6.
 FALLS er verwundet würfelst du wie gehabt auf injuries. Falls nicht, dann nicht. Danach addierst du 2 auf den animosity roll. Damit kannst du quasi das schlimmste Ergebnis (die 1) ausschließen.
Und in der Regel ohne kosten. Nur manchmal verwundest du eben unglücklich den henchman auf die 6.|
|I said ‚shut it!‘|No animosity within 6“ of the black ork hired sword|
|independent|no all alone test required|
|Who‘s da boss?|withon 6“ use leaders Ld-1 when alive. otherwise use BO‘s Ld. If BO‘s Ld >Leader Ld dann BO‘s Ld-1|
