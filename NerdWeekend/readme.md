**Equipment**
 - **Shields** give +2 to armour save (instead of +1) when in combat (when wielded with a one-handed weapon).
 - **Bucklers** give a +1 to armour save when in combat (when wielded with a one-handed weapon).
 - Increase the cost of **Hammers/Maces/Clubs** to 5 gc.
 - **Slings** are STR 2. Reduce range (to 16").
 - **Armour** is 50% cheaper 
 - **Crossbows** cannot use Quickshot.
 - **Handguns** cause +1 to injury rolls.
 - **Blunderbuss** may not shoot in combat
 - **Helmet** treats an injury roll of 1-3 as stunned (instead of the additional 4+ roll against stunned)
 - Introduce a new item, **Beat Stick**. It costs 3 gc, and is like a Hammer/Mace but without the Concussion special rule. Alternatively, separate Clubs from Hammers/Maces and remove the rule from clubs (while increasing the cost of Hammer/Maces).
 - **Ranged Weapons**: equipped by max 50% of your warband.
 - **Spears** will always Strike First the first round of combat, even when charged.
 - **Blackpowder weapons**: reduce prices by a third, rounding up.
 - **Blunderbuss ban**: Too wonky and no fun to be at the receiving end.
 - **Lucky Rabbits Foot, Lucky Charm, & Holy/Unholy Relics** are limited to 1 per warband.
 - **Short bows**: Range increased to 20".

**Combat**
 - **Dual wielding**: Both weapons, have -1 to hit. Only heroes may dual wield
 - **Strikes First**: Compare Initiative, then WS, before rolling off
 - **Parry**: Parrying adds WS to roll. For example, a skeleton parries a vampire. The skeleton rolls 4, adds +2 WS so results in 6. The Vampire rolls a 3 and adds +4 WS, so wins with a 7
 - **Critical Hits**: A roll of a 6 to wound no longer causes a critical hit. Instead, if you have wounded the target, roll another d6. On the result of a 6, a critical hit is caused â€“ use the advanced critical tables from the main rulebook. Skaven with the Art of Silent Death skill will cause critical hits on a 5 or 6 as usual on this roll.
 - **Failed Charge**: Stumble D6" forward

**Skills**
 - New common skill, Ambidextrous, avoids dual wielding penalty, and can be taken by any hero during advances. Hired Swords & Dramatis Personae that come with two weapons automatically have this skill.
 - Nurgle's Rot (Carnival of Chaos) is banned
 - Each skill may only be learned once in a warband

**Campaign**
 - Only non-evil Human Warbands
 - All heroes may search for Wyrdstones, even if they went ooA
