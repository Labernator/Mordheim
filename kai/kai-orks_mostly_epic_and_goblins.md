## Lore
Doomed are the orks of the bloody sunz clan, the black ork boyz are suffering of an diabolic injury.

The bloodlust was growing bigger and bigger over centuries and no one could satisfy their morbid hankering.
Even after a great Waaagh! thee most of the member of the clan cant stop to fight and to scrap each other of their
brotherhood. They are lost and doomed to eradicate themselves. Every of the few choosen shaman in the clan tried
to get the bloddy sunz to calm down and to scavange their brainz from the burning desire of the bloodlust.
All of them dies in a tremendous death of beaing eaten alive or got ripped in many parts.

Only one shaman survived the attack of the enraged orks - the nightgoblin shaman Gazbag. A gifted little and war proofen
warriour of the Waaagh! ant the friend of Grumlok the pack leader of the black ork clan - bloody sunz.

The orks charged onto the little goblin which tried to subdue their spirits, and
catched them before his friend and side kick Grumlok even could react. Gazbag was nocked down and the outraged
boyz tried to ead his head. The only chance Grumlok had to protect his friend was to fight the smaller boyz and
to kill them all. Grumlok wrenched the bleeding and knocked down goblin behind his enormous back, holding his battle axe
in his left big and mighty hand.
The slightly green glow in his eyes - a sign of the purity of his mind and the conneciton to the Waaagh! -
has shown up and he knew that will be the only way to get out of this situation.

He blows his axe in brutal and fast verves into the warband of the doomed orcs of his clan.
The guts, the glimbse and their forked heads swirled around him - he was enraged because of the stupidity of his
boyz to drink the evil water from the skaven warlock and the fact that they were dull enough to fight
agains its old friend and side kick Gazbag.

No thought was in his mind during the fight to keep an eye onto the knocked down friend.
A mistake which he would never forget to rue. A squig which did not know to difference between
scan and bodys or friends which leying on the ground started to eat the bleeding and broken open brain of Gazbag.

A few seconds ago in the edge of his eye Grumlok noticed a shrug of Gazbag's lifeless body.
He turned around and wrecked the squig with the blade of his axe into two parts.
Gazbag his long friend, his side kick, his pal was dead.

With an aweful roar, Grumlok repealed the body, notwithstanding that there are still doomed boyz around him,
he took him out of the camp. The doomed boys confused and iritated about the boss who stopped to fight them,
leaped directly to the next fighting brother on ther sided. None of them surwived the massacre of this battle.
The last doomey boy who surviced the battle died because he tried to fight against himself - he won in a heroic way of
a real ork warriour with a one hit decapitation.

Grumlok run - his target was the hut great shaman Wogga from the adversely clan of the
black snakes. An outstanding healer and also skillful in the usage of the Waaagh!.
Grumlok knew that his hut was a bit away from the camp of the clan. The black snake clan also know that it is to dangerous to keep shamans in
their camps. The Waaagh! they try to use and control lead to spontanous bursting heads and huts. No ork was save in the near of
an ork shaman outside of a battle.

His friend Gazbag fullfilled with the energy of the Waaagh! didn't die completely. The Waaagh! keept him alive,
at least his body. But his brain was eaten by the squig - which wasn't that bad because it prevented the burst of his head.
Grumlok was sure that there was no way to retrive it, it was a puddle of mud.
But hi does not accept that this may be the end of his mate.

Gazbak knows the shaman Wogga since the great Waagh! against the Northwall Elves n ancient times, which was a long time ago.
He knows him as a trustable savant, a healer and outstanding battle witcher using the Waaagh! but also as a loony mind.

It was his only chance to safe the live of Gazbag, find Wogga and heal him or something.
For about four days and three nights Grumlok run throu the mountain range and the wooden valley
till he arrived the hut of Woggle.

Reverent was the appearance of Wogga as he aready stand in front of the door of his hut. His eyes were concealed under his hood, but the
same slightly green glow was visible - as it was visible in the eyes of Grumlok during the fight between him and it's clan.

Grumlok still tells the story that Gazbag bend up his upper part of the body and the broken head and Woggle said some words of Magic to him,
but the truuth is that Woggle tried to focus a healing spell onto the dying body of Gazbag on the rite shrine in his hut. Two days he tried
to save him. Te regenerate his lost brain, to heal his broken head and to fullfil him with live. But at the end Woggle gave up, all his powers
fail. Gazbag brain was dead. Only the body and the ability to hold himself on the shoulderpad of Grumlok was regenerated.
For now Gazbag the braindead Goblin shaman was standing still on his shoulder and holding it's battle staff till his Waagh! fulfilled body
will die.

Grumlok tear up about the fact that his friend would be never tha same pal as before and after days of suffering he decided not to
go back and rescue his old clan - he didn't know that they are already dead.

He decided to leaf. To leaf the world he knows. To leaf his doomed clan. And his home. A achy truth has reached his mind, the War never will be
the same as before. With his twohanded battleaxe in his left hand and Gazbag on the shoulder of his armour he decamp the hut of Woggle,
turned around and spontanousely asked him to come along.

In his loony mind the giggeling stopped for a long second and Woggle assented, Woggle was tired to wait for the next visitor all the day in his hut.
And why don't accompany an old and retired warband leader on his adventures. Woggle never rue his descision - even because the giggeling in his head
doesn't stop long enough to finish even a short idea to the end.

Weeks and months tehy were lurch through the worls, no reason to stay, no reason to step on, no fight to blastoff not reason to retreat.
All happend during this oscure period of their ramble was that Wogga figgured out that Gazbag self-evidently appear as a catalyst for the Waaagh! he can use to reenforce his powers.

Til they met the brothers of yawn - a covey of war zesty nights goblins - four of them to be strictly correct.
Their names are Higgz / Snotz / Roddz the three spearmen and Gurnch the vicious swordfighter. Swords... Grumlock looked at the two enormous small human bread knive sizes chaser in his hand and on the top of their spears and started to grin.
He didn't know that toothpicks are used in combat.

Lorn - cause they lost their warband - and with a crank mood they mooched around a tavern they were not allowed to enter.
All they wanted was to get drunk becaus of ther lost pack and to sing about ther past combat.
A very musically group, aren't they?
They firsthand got a sympathy to Grumlok and Gazbag - persumeably because of the Goblin - and asked him in a goblish way if they can join
his warband. This would even be betther than mooching around a tavern and waiting for the stranger who confirmed to buy and bring them
a beer to them. The stranger can keep there goldcrown they said. And at least one of them wren't sure why it feal wrong to accompany a
really black ork leader with a braindead goblin shaman on his shoulder like monkeylike pet.

The goblins didn't bother about the goals of thero new warband and they are also not interested about the kind job they have to do.
Their primary need was satisfied now, to be part of a warband and follow a big leader - in their case a really aweful black ork with a
brutal battleaxe - what could be wrong with this happenstance.

Few weeks later and a lot of incvoluntarily involving fights because the goblins provoke every one in a range of sight of the environs because they are sure that
ther pack Grumlok leader hopefully follow and protect them against ther suspects of animosity.
But most of the Time Grumlok was not interested to save the goblins, the target that his small mind figured out was the money and the tresure the
suspects victims carry. Most of them carry a lot of goldcrown, armory and weapons. A few weeks later Grumlok collected a lot of equipment and money
and he was sure for now that the new goal in his live would be to hunt for treasure and scrap others for gold and armory.

This could go on for a long time he thought and keept the way of the road of plundering victims bags and all of the houses and taverns.
Til they met the three black orks aside the main street in a scurf during a thunderstorm.
The orkish warband stepped into the scurf and all of them got a sword or axe under their noses, or on the top of their heads because the goblins are that small.

Grumlok's eyes started to glow slightly green and his face started to show up very grim. Without any time lag one of the Orks the strongest one - Grommok - with the
twohanded war chopping weapon in his hand fall down first, followed by the other two outreaching combatands Karhag and Ug'lash.

Ther place in the rule of precedence was clear - as Grumlok would not lose it's strength and stop to demonstate it, the will follow. That's the simple rule of a
orkish clan Grumlok was born for. He always was the leader and he was able to play his role, even if he gave up his clan, and his live as a warboss.

The three ork heros told Grumlok that ther previous way was the road to Mordheim and that the assume that there are lots of treasures to loot, victims to mug,
and more challanges to pass as they want.

In this moment of fight and the clarification of hierarchy the warband of a mostly epic ork and goblins warband was born.
A warband to scavange huge amounts of gold crowns, conquer for treasures and copmete with other warbands for honor or at least not to get killed by other warbands.
