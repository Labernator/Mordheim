Viertens Wird ersetzt durch:
The Player with the lowest Campaign Points (CP) chooses an opponent. Then he rolls a D6:
1-2: choose a scenario | 3-5: randomize the scenario by rolling a D20/10 | 6: the opponent chooses the scenario
If a multiplayer scenario is chosen, the Player selecting the scenario also selects the additional Player 
If the scenario requires to choose a defender/attacker, the Player Who chose the scenario assigns roles. 

12. Exploration (Wyrdstone/Treasures/...)

13. NPC Movement 

- How Do NPCs move
a. Always random
b. Random unless they have an objective (e.g. Pegasus) 
C. Always toward Nearest enemy
d. Always toward Nearest enemy unless none is in sight (Random in that case) 

- When Do they charge
  a. Only when the charge is automatically completed (Movement + 2)
  b. Only when the charge is statistically lukely to be completed (e.g. Movement + 4)
  c. Whenever the charge is possible (Movement + 9)
  d. They get their own charge rules (e.g. Charge distance = 2 ° Movement) 
  
- Who Do they charge IF they have a choice 
a. Nearest enemy model
b. Models based on Aggro (IF a Model shot on the NPC it will be a higher value target) 
b1. Softest model (henchmen > heros, less XP > more XP) 
B2. Most prestigeous model (hero > henchmen, more XP > less XP) 

14. Chests/Treasures/etc. 

Should it be possible to drop them? 
Pro: more tactical possibilities
Contra: can lead to strange/unwanted Situation (e.g. Pegasus, carry with good char out of Fänger and handing to the beggar)
