### Szenario 4 (15.12.2018)

Der Plan war es mit der Warband von Haus zu Haus zu ziehen, dann in der Mitte des Spielfelds
mehrere Crates aufzunehmen und dann auf einer anderen Kante vom Spielfeld zu verschwinden.
Es war mir klar das es nicht einfach werden würde, und die Verluste würden sicher nicht unerheblich sein.
Doch ich war ganz zufrieden mit der idee die Ork Boyz vor zu schicken und ggfls. zurück zu lassen.
Der Troll sollte die Kisten in der Mitte verteidigen und die Kistenträger decken.

Ichbstellte meine WB wieder als erstes auf - das führt zu Kontrollverlust neben wem man spielt.

Leider ging mein Plan nicht ganz auf. Der Troll war fast durchgehend stupid und ist entweder herum gestanden oder hat sich mit halben Movement nach vorne bewegt.

Die Norsemen haben von Anfang an die verfolgung aufgenommen so das die orks letztendlich ihren weg durch die mitte abbrechen und zum Gegenschlag umdrehen mussten. Die alternative war es in einen Block Zwerge hinein zu rennen. Also keine Alternative.

Aufgrund guter positionierung konnte ich zumindest verhindern das Helden oder der Beggar schaden genommen haben.
Die Norsemen haben starken widerstand geleistet aber trotzdem konnte ich drei der Wölfe ooa bringen und der gegner hatte es nicht sonderlich leicht die Ork Boyz umzuhauen. Die fallen mit ihrem T4 einfach nicht so leicht.
Einer der Boyz wurde von den Zwergen ooa gebracht, nachdem er selbst einen Zwerg OOA gehauen hatte.
Fieser ist jetzt auch zum Helden befördert worden.

Leider sind zwei der Boyz per serious injury roll endgültig gestorben. Norog wurde wie geschrieben zum Helden.
Der black ork hired sword haut sie alle um, ihm fehlt aber noch der skill two handed master ung Fearful - falls er jemals einen neuen Skill erwürfelt bekommt. 
Das movement ist mit ihm deutlich angenehmer als mit animosity. Allerdings ist der upkeep sehr sehr hoch.

Auf sicherheit spielen hat sich bewährt, routen solange alle helden noch da sind und sich die möglichkeit ergibt macht sinn. 

Durch den engpass zwischen den häusern laufen war nicht die beste idee,
die hinteren figuren hätten den vorderen nicht zur hilfe eilen können. Zum glück ging es gut aus.
Nur der Troll hätte im Kampf noch gefehlt.

Der pegasus war enttäuschend. Da hätte ich mir mehr Action erwartet.

Die kämpfe waren sehr aufschlussreich, das mit der iniative und den attacken pro runde ist nun auch endlich klar. Eigentlich dachte ich das ich das mit der ToHit und ToWound Tabelle verstanden habe aber im Spiel kam es mir vor als müsste ich ständig andere Werte gegen die gleichen Figuren erwürfeln. Vermutlich kam es mir so vor weil alles so schnell geht umd man nicht jedesmal nachliest. Da fehlt mir Übung.

Fazit: Ich bin zugrieden, habe nun sechs Helden und für diese einige tolle Advances erhalten. Es kam genug Gold rein um die Warband wieder aufzustocken. Leider war aber kein Gold übrig um ein Paar neue Henchmen oder Ausrüstung zu kaufen.
Aus den Häusern kam fst kein Loot. Da hätte ich mehr erwartet, vir sllem da ich für drei Häuser gewüefelt habe.
Mit dem Troll werde ich noch ein paar Waaagh! Zauber veranstalten müssen damit ich seine Stupidity besser in den Griff bekomme, aber da sehe ich wenig Chancen. Es bleibt Zufall.

### Szenario 3 (18.11.2018)

Keiner wollte gegen meinen Troll kämpfen, daher habe ich gemütlich ein paar Bücher einsammeln können
und am Ende des Spiels mit Stefan eine Übereinkunft zum Abschluss des Spiels geschlossen.

Ergebnis: je ein XP für alle und 200gc mehr in der Schatzkiste.

Für die 200gc gab es einen Beggar, einen Black Ork hired sword und vier Ork boys mit je zwei Dolchen.

---

The last warband wasn‘t that bad and it was fun to test their behavior and skills. 
But our tabletop group decided to start over and everyone is allowed to rebuild a new warband.

I got a tip that the Black Ork Warband may be better than the normal orks. So I started to create a Black Ork warband.

Lore:

Grumlok stand still in front of his warband.
He looked ar Wogga, the three Black orks, the Boyz and the Goblins.
The treasure chest is empty and all their effort was unsuccessful.
His eyes narrowed and focused the goblins.
The boys saw this and slowly they stepped aside, away from the goblins. All of them were engaged in a scrap with each other. 
He tightnes his hand on the handle of his great axe. And with incredible speed of movement he charged the green ball of scrapping group.
With infernal fury he blow his axe theough them.
Limbs and esrs and broken weapon felt to the geound. The scrap was stopped instantly.
Dor now on Grumlok will never again will let animosity go on unpunished within his proximity.
He looked at the Boyz and they know for now on that they got big problem. They öooked at him and tried to stand stil.
„You ar black orks“ he yelled grunty to the black orks. Startled the rqised their eyes up to the boss and away from the scattered body parts and stopped laughting.

„I don se ya kill‘n da ard‘eads. Stop fooln aroun.“
He raised his left arm to point on them holding his great axe in his large claw.
Gazbag on his shoulderplate had problems to hold himself save while grumlok stepped i front of his three heros.

With his green glowing eyes he looked in the faces of them. At least one of them is not an full Black Ork, he thought. With a swift move of his right arm he grabbed Grommok, the stronger one of them.
„Tell me, which one of ya is not a true blood?“
he shouted in his face.
Grommok dosn‘t betray his mates, and Grumlok would not forgive a betrayer.

So Grumlok let him go and stepped in front of them
back and forth.
„Scrap“ he said slowly and quiet.
„I will see who is ya subject.“
„I said fight!!!“ he shouted.

Ant the three Orks started to scrap each other.
It was a terrible fight and it took a while til
the first was knocked down. Grumlok followed the fight sceptic and he also habe had a lot of tun to watch dem. He celebrated them and laughted loud out.
The boyz also celebrated them but they were still awear of the look of the boss so they would not become a thread in his eye.

„Enough!“ he yelled and the orks stopped to scrap.
„That is not enough! We need more of ya.“ he said with a serious sound in his thunderous voice.

Now he knows who of them wasn‘t a true black ork.
and for now on Grommok got the rank of a Young‘Un.
Grumlok was angry and he decided to have a look for new warband member.

A few days later Wogga talked to Grumlok. For him the adventure was over and he wanted to leaf. To go home.

Later on Grumlok managed to hire two other black orks, one for a small amount of gold crown but the second did not follow for free, he urges a fee after each raid and after some negotation he agree to join the warband under the lead of Grumlok.

Die letzte Warband wurde nochmals gedropt - alle fangen eine neue WB an.

### Szenario 2 (3.11.2018)

Scenario: The lost prince

Orks in neuer formation gegen Dwarf treasure hunters, die warband von Aaron.

Der Zwergen Noble hat sich den Prinz gegriffen und wollte langsam vom Spielfeld spazieren.
Die orks haben ihn jedoch eingekreist, es gab kein entkommen. Leider haben wir die reihenfolge im Kampf falsch interpretiert und auch einige andere regeln vergessen.

Die Zwerge haben die Orks nach und nach out of action gehauen bis sie routen mussten.
insgesamt hat aarons Warband 2 goblins, einen Ork Boy, den Boss und einen Helden erledigt gehabt.

Bis auf den einen Ork Boy haben sich alle vollständig erholt, der Ork ist seinen Verletzungen erlegen.

Die Zwerge mit ihren WS4 zu treffen ist schon schwierig, aber sie durch ihre T4 zu verwunden noch schwieriger. Stunned setzen und Knocked Down ist häufig passiert aber aufgrund der falschen Reihenfolge im Kampf (I-wert vergessen zu vergelichen) hatten die Zwerge meist den vorteil des ersten schlages gehabt.

Die Goblins waren dieses mal nur mit bögen bewaffnet und so nicht sonderlich hervorzuheben. Ihr Ziel haben sie getroffen aber niemanden ernsthaft verwundet.

Die andere Kämpfe verliefen ebenfalls ineffizient, knocked down und stunned schlagen war kein problem. Aber das ersehnte out of action blieb aus. Keiner der Zwerge ist gefallen.

Wogga hatte zweimal seinen Zzap! gesprochen und jeweils mit zwei Energieblitzen getroffen, aber nur einmal ein Stunned damit ausgelöst.

Die Ork Boys haben sich aufgrund von Animosity am ende noch gegenseitig umgehauen und ein Zwergen Schütze - ohne Nahkampfwaffe - einen Ork Hero umgehauen (knocked down).

Die animosity hat nach und nach die Gormation der Warband so außeinamder gerissen das sie nicht mehr verhindert werden konnte. So haben zwei Boys nicht am Kampf teil genommen und der Boss war ungeschützt.

Aaron einzukreisen und seine Bewegungen zu behindern war gut aber aufgeund seines Movements wäre er auch so fast nicht vom Tisch gekommen.

Die advances seiner Truppen nachdem er durch mein Routen gesiegt hatte waren enorm, ebenso wie der Aufsteig eines Henchmen zum Hero. Die schätze hielten sich im Grenzen.

Für die Orks gab es nur wenige XP doch Woggah bekam die Zauber Fooled Ya!. Die Warband hat einen Banner erwürfelt und 37gc bezahlt. Und einen Goblin gekauft.

Fazit:
- Gruppen zusammen halten und Animosity nachziehen
- FokusDamage, keiner kömpft alleine 
- Formation beibehalten
- Schiessen ist mist wenn nur einer schiesst
- Goblins und Ork Boys vor
- Magie zündet nicht und sonst muss man den Schamanen nur beschützen
- Figuren namen geben und den Roster besser beschriften damit es keine Missverständnisse gibt wer was wann wo getan hat

The last warband was dropped because of that the rout test may now be done after two out of action members.

### Szenario 1 (14.10.2018)

Scenario: The raven barracks

The first szenario happend recently.
Wogga died in a heroical fight agains two of the wood elf’s - thode with the dull ear.
Non of the magic he tried to cast work - the spell was to dificult to cast.
They sliced wogga into small peaces - incomprehensible why they didn't eat him.
A lot of money was spend to get him back into the warband. Some rumour happen in the foe warbands that the new Wogga isn't the same as before - he is just look alike.

The hardiness all of the goblins were outstanding. One of them killed a undead and Gurnch keept up to four foolish wood elfes for many rounds into the combat without dying. Snotz also did a very good job in his position and he also tried to save a tresure chest until he got charged by some other wood elf, which tried to kill him a lot of rounds
till they got him out of action.

Ug'Lash tried to help his goblin buddy gurnch while he carrie a treasure chest on his back.
He killed the Wood Elf Leader and keept all the enemies in battle around him out of breath. But in the end the wooden elf leader was revived and Ug'Lash got killed by the overhelming enemies.
Gurnch died during this battle and after that Ug'Lash tried to escape but the elves hit him sneaky and deadly from behind.

In another place in mordheim, Grumlok and the two Big'Uns Grommok and Karhag tried to get some tresure chests out of the battle but a Vampire tried to kill some of the goblins. The vampire always failed - in any case, don't bother with a goblin which does not wear armor.
Snotz tried his luck but was unable to kill the vampire. 
Grumlok did it later, the vampire hadn't any chance and the undead withdrawn. Far away from the ork warband.

A few later the undeads were gone because they used a rotten dice while they have to do a rout test.

The first scenario war outstanding and the performance to the Orks also. They fought to their enemies and are very hardy but they lost the focus after a few rounds. A few of them earned some experience and to many of them got killed.
To greedy was the warband master and now they got nothing except of died pals and a lot loss of gold crown.

## Lore
Doomed are the orks of the bloody sunz clan, the black ork boyz are suffering of an diabolic injury.

The bloodlust was growing bigger and bigger over centuries and no one could satisfy their morbid hankering.
Even after a great Waaagh! thee most of the member of the clan cant stop to fight and to scrap each other of their
brotherhood. They are lost and doomed to eradicate themselves. Every of the few chosen shaman in the clan tried
to get the bloddy sunz to calm down and to scavenge their brains from the burning desire of the bloodlust.
All of them dies in a tremendous death of being eaten alive or got ripped in many parts.

Only one shaman survived the attack of the enraged orks - the nightgoblin shaman Gazbag. A gifted little and war proofen
warrior of the Waaagh! and the friend of Grumlok the pack leader of the black ork clan - bloody sunz.

The orks charged onto the little goblin which tried to subdue their spirits, and
catched them before his friend and side kick Grumlok even could react. Gazbag was knocked down and the outraged
boyz tried to ead his head. The only chance Grumlok had to protect his friend was to fight the smaller boyz and
to kill them all. Grumlok wrenched the bleeding and knocked down goblin behind his enormous back, holding his battle axe
in his left big and mighty hand.
The slightly green glow in his eyes - a sign of the purity of his mind and the connection to the Waaagh! -
has shown up and he knew that will be the only way to get out of this situation.

He blows his Axe in brutal and fast verves into the warband of the doomed orcs of his clan.
The guts, the limbs and their forked heads swirled around him - he was enraged because of the stupidity of his
boyz to drink the evil water from the skaven warlock and the fact that they were dull enough to fight
agains its old friend and side kick Gazbag.

No thought was in his mind during the fight to keep an eye onto the knocked down friend.
A mistake which he would never forget to rue. A squig which did not know to difference between
scam and bodys or friends which lie on the ground started to eat the brain out of the bleeding and broken open head of Gazbag.

A few seconds ago in the edge of his eye Grumlok noticed a shrug of Gazbag's lifeless body.
He turned around and wrecked the squig with the blade of his Axe into two pieces.
Gazbag his long friend, his side kick, his pal was dead.

With an awful roar, Grumlok repealed the body, notwithstanding that there are still doomed boyz around him,
he took him out of the camp. The doomed boys confused and irritated about the boss who stopped to fight them,
leaped directly to the next fighting brother on their sided. None of them survived the massacre of this battle.
The last doomed boy who survived the battle died because he tried to fight against himself - he won in a heroic way of
a real ork warrior with a one hit decapitation.

Grumlok run - his target was the hut great shaman Woggah from the adversely clan of the
black snakes. An outstanding healer and also skillful in the usage of the Waaagh!.
Grumlok knew that his hut was a bit away from the camp of the clan. The black snake clan also know that it is to dangerous to keep shamans in
their camps. The Waaagh! they try to use and control lead to spontaneous bursting heads and huts. No ork was save in the near of
an orkide shaman outside of a battle.

His friend Gazbag fulfilled with the energy of the Waaagh! didn't die completely. The Waaagh! keept him alive,
at least his body. But his brain was eaten by the squig - which wasn't that bad because it prevented the burst of his head.
Grumlok was sure that there was no way to retrieve it, it was a puddle of mud.
But he does not accept that this may be the end of his mate.

Gazbak knows the shaman Woggah since the great Waagh! against the Northwall Elves n ancient times, which was a long time ago.
He knows him as a trust-able savant, a healer and outstanding battle witcher using the Waaagh! but also as a loony mind.

It was his only chance to safe the live of Gazbag, find Woggah and heal him or something.
For about four days and three nights Grumlok run through the mountain range and the wooden valley
till he arrived the hut of Woggah.

Reverent was the appearance of Woggah as he already stand in front of the door of his hut. His eyes were concealed under his hood, but the
same slightly green glow was visible - as it was visible in the eyes of Grumlok during the fight between him and it's clan.

Grumlok still tells the story that Gazbag bend up his upper part of the body and lifted up the broken head after Woggah said some words of Magic,
but the truth is that Woggah tried to focus a healing spell onto the dying body of Gazbag on the rite shrine in his hut. Two days he tried
to save him. Te regenerate his lost brain, to heal his broken head and to fulfill him with live. But at the end Woggah had to gave up, all his powers
fail. Gazbag'sbrain was dead. Only the body and the ability to hold himself on the shoulder Armour of Grumlok was regenerated.
For now on Gazbag the brain dead Goblin shaman was standing still on the shoulder of his friend and leader Grumlok. holding it's battle staff until his Waaagh!
fulfilled body will die.

Grumlok tear up about the fact that his friend would be never the same pal as before and after days of suffering he decided not to
go back and rescue his old clan - he didn't know that they are already dead.

He decided to leave. To leaf the world he knows. To leaf his doomed clan. And his home. A achy truth has reached his mind, the War never will be
the same as before. With his two-handed battle axe in his left hand and Gazbag on the shoulder of his Armour, he decamp the hut of Woggah,
turned around and spontaneously asked him to come along.

In his loony mind the giggling stopped for a long second and Woggah assented, he was tired to wait for the next visitor all the day in his hut.
And why don't accompany an old and retired warband leader on his adventures. Woggah never rue his decision - even because the giggling in his head
doesn't stop long enough to finish even a short idea to the end.

Weeks and months they were lurch through the world, no reason to stay, no reason to step on, no fight to blastoff no reason to retreat.
All happen during this obscure period of their ramble was that Woggah figured out that Gazbag self-evidently appear as a catalyst for the Waaagh!
\- he can use to re-enforce his powers.

Later on they met the brothers of yawn - a covey of war zesty night goblins - four of them to be strictly correct.
Their names are Higgz, Snotz and Roddz the three spear-men and Gurnch the vicious sword fighter. Swords...
Grumlock looked at the two enormous small human bread knives sized chaser in their hand and on the top of their spears and started to grin.
He didn't know that toothpicks are used in combat.

Lorn - cause they lost their warband - and with a crank mood they mooched around a tavern, they were not allowed to enter.
All they wanted was to get drunk because of their lost pack and to sing about their past glorious fight.
Rodz also own a battle flute.
They are a very musically group, aren't they?

They firsthand got a sympathy to Grumlok and Gazbag - presumably because of the Goblin - and asked him in a direct goblish way if they can join
his warband. This would even be better than mooching around a tavern and waiting for the stranger who confirmed to buy and bring them
some beer. At least no one of the group were sure why it feel wrong to accompany a black ork leader with a braindead goblin shaman on his shoulder,
standing there like monkey like pet.

The goblins also didn't bother about the goals of their new warband and they are also not interested about the kind of job they have to do.
Their primary need was satisfied now, to be part of a warband and follow a big leader - in their case a really awful black ork with a
brutal Battleaxe - what could be wrong with this happenstance.

Few weeks later - and a lot of incvoluntarily started fights - because the goblins provoke every one in a range of sight. Crazily, every time they
are sure that Grumlok will follow and protect them against their suspects of animosity.

But most of the time Grumlok was not interested to save the goblins, the target that his small mind figured out was the money and the treasure the
suspects victim carry. Most of them carry a lot of goldcrown, armory and weapon.

A few weeks later Grumlok collected a lot of equipment and money. He was sure for now that the new goal in his live would be to
hunt for treasure and scrap others for gold and armory.

This could go on for a long time he thought and kept the way of the road of plundering victim bags and all of the houses and taverns on theit way.

Untill they met three heroic orks aside the main street in a scurf. A outraging thunderstorm hovering over their heads.
Grumlok and his little warband stepped into the scurf and all of them instantly got a sword or Axe under their nose, or at least on the top of their
heads - goblins are that small.

Grumlok's eyes started to glow slightly green and his face started to show up very grim. Without any notable time lag one of the Orks - Grommok, the strongest one
with the two-handed war chopping weapon in his hand - fell down first. Followed by the other two outreaching combatants Karhag and Ug'lash.

Their place in the rule of precedence was clear - as Grumlok would not lose it's strength and stop to demonstrate it. The tree will follow for now on.
That's the simple rule of a orkish clan Grumlok was born for. He always was a leader and he was able to play his role, even if he gave up his clan, and his live as a warboss.

The three ork heroes told Grumlok that their previous target was the road to Mordheim and that they assume that there are lots of treasures to loot, victims to mug,
and more challenges to pass as they can.

In this moment of fight and the clarification of hierarchy the warband of mostly epic orks and goblins were born.
A warband to scavenge huge amounts of gold crowns, conquer for treasures and compete with other warbands for honor or at least not to get killed.
