notes: |
  Rosary: A prayer user wearing a Rosary may re-roll a failed Difficulty test if he has not done anything that turn except moving (no running) or remaining stationary. A Rosary cannot be used in combat.
  No Armor allowed: The Model cannot wear any armor.
  Sigmarite Warhammer: +1 Strength, Concussion 
  Healing Hand (Complexity 5): Any one model within 2 inch of the Priest (including himself) may be healed. The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, if any friendly models within 2 inch are stunned or knocked down, they immediately come to their senses, stand up, and continue fighting as normal.
  A war horn may be sounded once per battle at the beginning of any of the player's turn (just before a rout test). It allows the warband to increase its Leadership by +1. The effect will last until the start of the next turn. 
  Dark Steel: Concussion, Critical Damage (+1 Injury Rolls)
