Every enemy which gets charged by the goblin also has to pass a initiative test, if the test fails the charged enemy has an additional -1 to hit modifier in the first round (-2 to hit in sum), because he hasn't seen him coming.
If revealed in combat, because of any iniative test to reveal him (by any attacker which tries to unhide him) is successful, the goblin does no more count as hidden - for this fight but the general -1 to hit count still applies.

## Goblin mushroom steroids
The goblin has lokked upon the bad moon for decades. He worshiped him, he sacrefice him. And he alsp prayed to him.
His engagement was well known in the forests of the gobline homeland.
So even the loon king himself has heard of the goblin which nevers stops to pray to tha bad moon. And now Skragrott has sent him to go to his highest shaman. A shaman which was gifted by the bad moon himself.

The goblin went to him and tha shaman accepted to give him a single gift. They have to proceed a long ritual, in which they connect their tongues with those of spiders. In the the ritual has ended upon drinking a delicious mushroom tea.

Fulfilled with the will of tha bad moon, the great shaman gave the hero a little bag fulfilled with special mushrooms pieces - very small pieces. Thes mushrooms of the bad moon, which were grown up in the darkest hour of tha night, in the darkish light, these mushrooms are fulfilled by the bad moons energy.

He also adviced him not to eat all at once, only one small piece at once.
He will know what the effect is when he has tasted the first.
If he doesn't care about he will suffer the curse of the loon king himself.
But he is welcome to come back if he ever need more of the blended mushroom.

The goblin does not care about the shamans warning.

He hates every other races except of orks & goblins.
The hate of the moon king doesn't break the goblins fear of the orks.
The hate of the loon king is so strong that the it (reroll failed hit) applies to every round.
The anesthetic beside effect the mushroom have is that the goblin no longer feel any pain, his toughness is increases by +2T.

The effect ends when the goblin is ooA, or he does not count as in combat. Like he has taken all of his enemy ooA, he was previously engaged to in combat.

The massive power of the mushroom overhelms the goblin every time he doesn’t beware of the loon king’s course.
The course lead to a loss of one random stat on a D6=4+ permanently.
The stat can not be reduced below the value the hero had when he was initially bought by the player.
In case of that the rolled random stat can’t be reduced anymore - reroll.
