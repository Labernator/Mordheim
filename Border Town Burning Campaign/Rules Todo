2 IF no enemy is in charge distance, the NPC either makes a march move towards its objective or moves at random (2D6? Or march?)
3 IF any enemy model has attacked the npc, or Contests an objective which the npc is guarding, this Model has the highest priority for the npc
4 IF two or more enemy models are tied for priority, the npc randomizes between them.
