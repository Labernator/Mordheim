notes: |
         - If encounter beastmen: roll D6 "Traces to Chaos" (1-3 nothing happens, 4-5 Leader is frenzy, 6 add 1CP to your warband).
         - Animosity: 1 charge henchmen/hired sword if the next unit is not a hero, 2-5 do nothing, 6 charge next foe or move 4". Move another 4" or run in the movement phase in enemy direction. Charge if a foe is in charge range.
         - Lucky charm: D6 4+ first hit discard for Grumlok (on 6 it cant be used anymore after, it breaks)
         - Grumlok hates Scion of darknes leader, he has to charge them if in reach
         - Grumlok 4+ stunned save & Parry on >= hit & 5+ wound save (no mod)
         - Income scenario 3: Sold 5 wyrdstone (1 from scenario 3) = 70gc + (double 5 = axe + lucky charm)
           => 70gc + 13gc (treasure chest) = 83gc
         - Bought: 1 sword (10gc) + 1 squig (15gc) + 3 goblins (15gc) + 2 axe (5gc) => 80gc
