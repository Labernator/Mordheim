notes: |
  Roll for runes before battle (1D6 -> Rune, (2x) 2D6 -> Difficulty (2=damaged, <=no effect, >==profit!)
  Don't forget Ragnar has Blackblood now! (Anyone in base contact got S3 hit if wounded)
  Ivar hit on 3 and 3, not 3 and 5 (Two-Weapon Master)
  Rout test on 4 OOA this time (thanks Gordon) (Roll 2D6; >10 => Game over)
  Hard to kill (1,2 = knocked down, 3,4,5 = stunned, 6 = ooa)
  Hatred on Orcs/Goblins (Reroll missed hit on any fight in first round)
  Use Bow as much as possible (Range 24", S3)
