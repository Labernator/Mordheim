For the 2024 Campaign edition we want to do a lot of things differently/better than before.
We have seen more than mordheim by now and know of its short comings.
Let's use this list to guide the conversation. 

## Alternating activation

Marius: Turn based activation is stupid.
Is there any issue with alternating activation in Mordheim?
Is Group activation an issue?

Philipp: Aus meiner Sicht sollte dies problemlos integrierbar sein. Für die Groupactivation würde ich den selben Mechanismus wie bei Necromunda vorschlagen. Jeder Held darf zusätzlich 2 Modelle in 3 Zoll? Entfernung mitaktivieren.

## Lasting injury table

Marius: The injury table in mordheim feels bad and too punishing.
I would suggest to alter it to be more like Necromunda.


LASTING INJURY TABLE
| D66 | Injury Name |	Lasting Injury |
| :-----: |-------------| :-----|
| 11	| Lesson Learned: | The fighter goes into Convalescence but gains D3 Experience. |
| 12	| Impressive Scars: | The fighter’s Leadership is increased by 1. This bonus only applies once, treat all further results as Out Cold. |
| 13	| Horrid Scars: | The fighter gains the Fearsome skill. If they already have the Fearsome skill, treat this result as Out Cold. |
| 14	| Bitter Enmity: | When fighting a battle against the warband that inflicted this injury, the fighter gains the Hatred skill against that warband. If they already have the Hatred skill or roll this result a second time, treat it as Out Cold. |
| 15-26 |	Out Cold: | The fighter misses the rest of the battle, but avoids any long term injuries. The fighter recovers in time to perform post-battle actions. |
| 31-36	| Convalescence:| The fighter goes into Convalescence. |
| 41	| Old Battle Wound: | At the end of each battle this fighter participates in roll a D6, on a 1 the fighter goes into Convalescence. |
| 42	| Partially Deafened: | The fighter suffers no penalty if they are partially deafened, however, suffering this injury again reduces their Leadership by 1. |
| 43	| Humiliated: | The fighter goes into Convalescence and their Leadership is decreased by 1. |
| 44	| Eye Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Ballistic Skill characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 45	| Hand Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Weapon Skill characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 46	| Hobbled: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Movement characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 51	| Spinal Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Strength characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 52	| Enfeebled: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Toughness characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 53	| Head Injury: | The fighter goes into Recovery and their Initiative characteristic is each decreased by 1. |
| 54	| Multiple Injuries: | The fighter is not dead but has suffered many serious wounds. Roll a further D3 times on this table re-rolling any results of Captured, Multiple Injuries, Memorable Death, Critical Injury or Out Cold. |
| 55-56	| Captured: | The fighter might be Captured. |
| 61-65	| Critical Injury: | The fighter is in a critical condition – if their injuries are not successfully treated by a visit to the Doc (see Medical Escort) in the post-battle sequence, they will die. |
| 66	| Memorable Death: | The fighter is killed instantly – not even the most talented Doc can save them. If the injury was caused by an Attack action, the attacker gains 1 additional XP. |

Convalescence heißt für mich, dass der Mann nicht für die Wyrdstone Suche und so nicht zur Verfügung steht.
Habe Int durch Ini ersetzt und Cool gestrichen. Leadership ist king! ;)
Berserker habe ich durch Hatred ersetzt.

Sonst mapped das echt gut. Einzig für die Critical Injury müssen wir uns etwas überlegen. Gibt es dann auch nen rogue doc?

Philipp: Alternative hierzu wäre, dass man Hardened (61-62), Horrible Scars (63-64) und Sold to the Pits (65) mit aufnimmt

Stefan: Multiple Injuries (D3?) wäre auch eine Option

## Advancements

Marius: I dislike the random aspect of the mordheim advances. It feels bad to get only leadership when all others are buffing strength and toughness

#### Heroes 

| Cost	| Advancement (Heroes)	| Cost Increase |
| :-----: |-------------| :-----|
| 3 XP	| Improve the fighter’s Leadership characteristic by 1.	| +5 gc |
| 4 XP	| Improve the fighter’s Initiative characteristic by 1.	| +10 gc |
| 5 XP	| Add 1" to the fighter’s Movement characteristic.	| +10 gc |
| 6 XP	| Improve the fighter’s Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill characteristic by 1.	| +20 gc |
| 6 XP	| The fighter gains a random skill from one of their Sets.	| +20 gc |
| 8 XP	| Increase the fighter’s Strength or Toughness characteristic by 1.	| +30 gc |
| 9 XP	| The fighter gains a skill of your choice from one of their Primary Skill Sets.	| +35 gc |
| 12 XP	| Increase the fighter’s Wounds or Attacks characteristic by 1.	| +45 gc |

#### Henchmen 

| 2D6	| Advancement (Henchmen)	| Cost Increase |
| :-----: |-------------| :-----|

| 8-9	| Improve the fighter’s Attack characteristic by 1.	| +5 gc |
| 10-11	| Improve the fighter’s Leadership characteristic by 1. | +10 gc |
| 12	| The henchman becomes a Hero.	| +20 gc |

## Gainging EXP
+ 1 Winning Leader
+ 1 Taking Part
+ 1 Serious Injury Henchman
+ 2 Serious Injury Hero
+ 2 taking Henchmen OOA
+ 3 taking Hero OOA
+ 1 Medical Aid

Philipp: würde das EXP System für euch passen? 


## Critical hits

Marius: Crits are a problem in my opinion... period. Armour is completely irrelevant when you have crits.

Philipp: Möglich wäre auch, dass man die Crits erst nach einem verpatzten Save-Roll durchführt. Wenn der Save passt, gibt es keine Crits.

Stefan: Problem ist, dass dann einige Rolls nichts mehr machen, weil sie nur die Armour negieren. Ich würde die Crits einfach cutten. Geht nicht viel verloren, meiner Meinung nach.

## Injury rolls

Marius: I love this necromunda mechanic. Can we port that somehow? 
Philipp: Same Same, gibt es hier eine Einschänkung Mordheimseitig? Mir wäre keine bekannt. 
Wenn Wunde auf 0, könnte man anschließend für jede weitere Wunde den Wundwürfel werfen inkl. der Regeln 

When any number of Injury dice are rolled against a fighter for any reason, apply the results of each individual dice against that fighter as follows:

Out of Action: The fighter succumbs to their injuries and is immediately removed from play and will take no further part in this battle.

Serious Injury: If a Standing or Prone and Pinned fighter suffers a Serious Injury result, they become Prone and Seriously Injured. If they suffer more than 1 Serious Injury result, each additional result after the first causes them to suffer a Flesh Wound. If this injury was inflicted in close combat, the fighter may be vulnerable to a Coup De Grace (Simple) action.

Should a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter suffer one or more Serious Injury results, they suffer an additional Flesh Wound for each.

Flesh Wound: The fighter suffers a Flesh Wound, reducing their Toughness characteristic by 1. If a fighter is reduced to Toughness 0, they go Out of Action.

## Hero wounds

Marius: it feels strange that most heroes only have 1 wound. I like the necromunda heroes with at least 2. Maybe we can modify something here (+1 Wound for all heros on creation for another 30gc or something like this)  
Philipp: Wenn alle Helden +1 Wunde erhalten, kann man die Kosten auch beibehalten oder?  
Stefan: Man könnte die +1W Optional machen für 20-30GC. Dann hat man die Option immer noch günstige Youngbloods anzuheuern, falls man das möchte.

## Mutiny in Marienburg

Marius: We need to shorten the campaign to max. 8-9 games. Otherwise we will NEVER finish it.

## Fixed income (Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen)

Stefan: Necromunda with its territories introduced fixed income for all bands. This is a good mechanism, we should port to Mordheim so the "rich get richer" is not that big a problem as in the past  
Philipp: 2xd3x10 as fix income? evtl. 3d3x10 

Mir gefällt hier die Variante von Wyrdwars ganz gut: https://www.wyrdwars.com/Wyrdwars_Rulebook.pdf (s.35) 

## Warband Size
Stefan: Um die Menge an Minis auf dem Tisch etwas einzudännen schlage ich folgendes System vor: Alle starten mit einem Warband (+ Hired Swords) Limit von 12. Pro Spiel erhöht es sich um 1 bis zum Maximum das der Warband normalerweise zusteht.

## Old House rules revisited
Here is the list of house rules from our last campaign:

### Charge
> A charge move is done by adding +D6 to the movement of a warrior instead of doubling the movement (Core S. 26). Therefore you are always allowed to measure.

Marius: after playing Necromunda I got a taste of "no measuring". I would just remove the last part of the sentence but keep the variance in charges
Philipp: good One  
Stefan: Agree with Marius

### Armour
> Light, Heavy und Gromril Armour have +1 AS (Core S. 32). Light Armour grants a 5+, Heavy Armour a 4+ and Gromril Armour a +3+ AS.

Marius: good one
Philipp: Good One:  
Stefan: Good one

### Dual Wielding
> When using two weapons in melee, both weapons are resolved at -1 to hit (Core S. 35)

Marius: good one
Philipp: + Combat Skill dual Wielding witout malus?  
Stefan: Die Regel und den Skill gibt es in der MiM Kampagne.

### Henchmen are only here for the rations
> Henchmen do not gain experience. After 3 scenarios you may choose one non-large, non-animal henchman to be promoted. If for any reason, you don't have 6 heroes after game 5, another non-large, non-animal henchman is promoted.

Marius: I don't like this one. It marginalizes henchmen. But with the random advance system this is a source of heavy imbalance.
Philipp: Ich würde die Progression analog zu Necromunda nehmen. Jeder Henchman kann für sich besser werden, keine Groupen Bonuse, das wäre zu hart.

### Shots fired!
> No more than 50% of warriors within a warband (both heroes and henchmen) may be equipped with a ranged weapon that has a range of more than 6".

Marius: good one  
Stefan: Good one

### Large / Animal Henchmen
> Henchmen with either the "Large" or the "Animal" rule can neither climb nor use ladders.

Marius: good one  
Stefan: Good one

### Too many heroes to divide the spoils
> Every warband may have at maximum 5 starting heroes. No more. It doesn't matter what the warband book says.

Marius: goodish. Warbands with 6 heroes are mostly sketchy. Maybe we can take another hard look at them?!  
Stefan: Norse haben 6. Ich finde die Regel immer noch ok.

### Banned skills for this campaign:
Strongman
Sprint
Quick shot
Shaggy Hide (Beastmen)
Nurgle's Rot

Marius: I have mixed feelings. We banned these because they were auto includes. Turned out, now we had other auto includes. I can see us go either way.
Philipp: würde diese wieder mitaufnehmen  
Stefan: Free them all!

### Winning
> Every warband that fulfills the winning conditions is considered a winner. Meaning there can be more than one winner. All winning warband leader e.g. gain +1 XP.

Marius: good one  
Stefan: Good one

### Strongman
> If a model already has the Strongman skill, it loses it and therefore gains the "No need for Weapons" skill that ignores the penalties of fighting unarmed.

Marius: see the comment above regarding the ban list.

### Underdog
> The underdog bonus is calculated against the strongest opposing warband.

Marius: good one  
Stefan: Good one

### Szenario Auswahl
> The warband with the lowest warband rating may choose the next scenario. If two or more warbands are tied for last place, roll off to see who may decide.

Marius: bad one. We want to have campaign progression  
Stefan: Weg damit

### The Hero Save
> After rolling all the injuries of your warband, and contemplating the total annihilation that would soon follow, the player may decide to call upon the Hero Save.\nIn doing so, the player decides to ignore all the injuries to all the models in the warband, but also renounces to all the experience gains of the game. All other post battle sequence steps take place as normal.\nNote: The exploration can therefore be made by all the heroes in the warband, as none was removed from the game.

Marius: this plays with the harsh mordheim injury table. If that would be softened a bit, I could see us keep this rule but have it never used!?

### MAGA (Make Armour great again)
> On the critical hit chart we replace all instances of "no armour saves allowed" with "the enemy armour save is modified by -2."

Marius: The critical hits in general are a problem as stated above
Philipp: Würde erst Armour Save und erst bei verlorenem Save Crits abhandeln 

### Climbing
> Replace the second paragraph with this: \nAny model (except animals!) can climb up or down fences, walls, etc.\nHe must be touching what he wants to climb. He may climb up to his total Movement in a single movement phase.\nAny remaining movement can be used as normal.\nIf the height is more than the model’s normal move, he cannot climb the wall.

Marius: good one  
Stefan: Good one

### Unclaimed loot
> When all other players have routed, the remaining player gains an additional movement phase in which he might claim any loot on the table. All unclaimed loot after that phase is lost.

Marius: good one  
Stefan: Good one. müsste allerdings dann irgendwie 2 Aktionen heißen, oder so.
