notes: |
  Roll for runes before battle (1D6 -> Rune, (2x) 2D6 -> Difficulty (2=damaged, <=no effect, >==profit!)
  Blackblood (Ragnar) = Anyone in base contact got S3 hit if wounded
  Expert Axeman (Ragnar) = Reroll all failed hits when charging (axe only)
  Helmet (Ragnar, Floki) = 4+ save against stunned
  Two-Weapon Master (Ivar) = hit on 3 and 3, not 3 and 5
  Cutting Edge (Axe) = -1 save modifier
  Rout test on 4 OOA this time (thanks Gordon) (Roll 2D6; >10 => Game over)
  Hard to kill (1,2 = knocked down, 3,4,5 = stunned, 6 = ooa)
  Hatred on Orcs/Goblins (Reroll missed hit on any fight in first round)
  Use Bow as much as possible (Range 24", S3)
  Incomarable Miners (+1 Wyrdstone at the end (3 heros + 1 = 4 WS))
