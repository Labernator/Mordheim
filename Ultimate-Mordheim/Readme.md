# Ultimate Mordheim

## Regeln
Gespielt werden die richtig offiziellen Mordheim Regeln. Erstmal fast ohne Houserules und alles, sprich:
 - Mordheim Core Rulbook
 - Mordheim Annul 2002
 - Empire in Flames

Dazu Szenarios die entweder im Town Cryer oder in Fanatic Online veröffentlicht wurden.

Alle spielbaren Warbands findet sich [hier](https://github.com/Labernator/Mordheim/tree/master/Ultimate-Mordheim/Warbands).

## Campaign

## Houserules
#### Charge
> A charge move is done by adding +D6 to the movement of a warrior instead of doubling the movement (Core S. 26). Therefore you are always allowed to measure.
#### Armour
> Light, Heavy und Gromril Armour have +1 AS (Core S. 32). Light Armour grants a 5+, Heavy Armour a 4+ and Gromril Armour a +3+ AS.
#### Dual Wielding
> When using two weapons in melee, both weapons are resolved at -1 to hit (Core S. 35)
#### Henchmen are only here for the rations
> Henchmen do not gain experience. After 3 scenarios you may choose one non-large, non-animal henchman to be promoted. If for any reason, you don't have 6 heroes after game 5, another non-large, non-animal henchman is promoted.
#### Shots fired!
> No more than 50% of warriors within a warband (both heroes and henchmen) may be equipped with a ranged weapon that has a range of more than 6\".
#### Large / Animal Henchmen
> Henchmen with either the \"Large\" or the \"Animal\" rule can neither climb nor use ladders.
#### Too many heroes to divide the spoils
> Every warband may have at maximum 5 starting heroes. No more. It doesn't matter what the warband book says.

#### Banned skills for this campaign:

- Strongman
- Sprint
- Quick shot
- Shaggy Hide (Beastmen)
- Nurgle's Rot

#### Winning
> Every warband that fulfills the winning conditions is considered a winner. Meaning there can be more than one winner. All winning warband leader e.g. gain +1 XP.

#### Strongman
> If a model already has the Strongman skill, it loses it and therefore gains the "No need for Weapons" skill that ignores the penalties of fighting unarmed.

#### Underdog
> The underdog bonus is calculated against the strongest opposing warband.

#### Szenario Auswahl
> The warband with the lowest warband rating may choose the next scenario. If two or more warbands are tied for last place, roll off to see who may decide.

#### The Hero Save
> After rolling all the injuries of your warband, and contemplating the total annihilation that would soon follow, the player may decide to call upon the Hero Save.\nIn doing so, the player decides to ignore all the injuries to all the models in the warband, but also renounces to all the experience gains of the game. All other post battle sequence steps take place as normal.\nNote: The exploration can therefore be made by all the heroes in the warband, as none was removed from the game.

#### MAGA (Make Armour great again)
> On the critical hit chart we replace all instances of "no armour saves allowed" with "the enemy armour save is modified by -2."

#### Climbing
> Replace the second paragraph with this: \nAny model (except animals!) can climb up or down fences, walls, etc.\nHe must be touching what he wants to climb. He may climb up to his total Movement in a single movement phase.\nAny remaining movement can be used as normal.\nIf the height is more than the model’s normal move, he cannot climb the wall.

#### Unclaimed loot
> When all other players have routed, the remaining player gains an additional movement phase in which he might claim any loot on the table. All unclaimed loot after that phase is lost.
